            <h3>History of Taiwanese Food</h3>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="historyinfo-section">
        <div class="historyinfo-card">
            <p>Taiwanese food has deep roots in its indigenous cultures, which relied on local ingredients like millet, taro, and sweet potatoes. Early cooking methods focused on grilling, steaming, and preserving foods with salt, shaped by the island's tropical climate and available resources.</p>
            <p>When Han Chinese settlers arrived from Fujian and Guangdong in the 1600s, they introduced soy sauce, rice, noodles, and various stir-frying and braising techniques. This blending of traditions laid the foundation for many classic Taiwanese dishes, combining coastal Chinese flavors with local produce.</p>
            <p>During Japan's rule from 1895 to 1945, Western-style desserts, tempura, and bento boxes became part of everyday cuisine. Later, the arrival of mainland Chinese refugees in 1949 added even more regional diversity. Today, Taiwanese food celebrates this mix of influences through favorites like beef noodle soup, popcorn chicken, and bubble tea.</p>

        <div class="historyinfo-card">
            <p>Taiwanese cuisine carries centuries of culture, and MonGa Café brings that legacy to America with care and authenticity. Inspired by Monga, the historic Wanhua District of Taipei, the restaurant reflects the area's vibrant food scene and deep cultural roots. Every dish tells part of Taiwan's story; from crispy fried chicken and hearty beef noodle soup to vegetarian specialties that showcase local freshness and balance. By using real tea leaves in its milk tea and lighter, healthier ingredients in its recipes, MonGa Café honors traditional flavors while catering to modern tastes. More than just a place to eat, it's a celebration of Taiwan's culinary spirit, served with warmth and pride.</p>
